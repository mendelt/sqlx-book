# Getting started

This chapter shows you how to set up a simple application using SQLx to connect to a database and
run SQL commands on the database. How you can use the SQLx cli tool to manage your database, create
database schema migrations so you can easilly grow your database together with your application and
how to map datatypes in your application to rows in your database and back.

We will use PostreSQL for these examples and will assume you have a PostreSQL database running

TODO: add some links on how to set up Postres
